This study presents a novel predictive model based on machine learning which detects agriculture disturbances from climate change. Study Objectives are as follows:
1.	To assess the effects of climate variability on yields of major food crops: Analysing crop production data by district, alongside data on climate and demographic variables, this study aims at identifying the major climatic variables associated with crop yields in three major crops.
2.	To apply machine learning models to crop yield forecasting: Using machine learning techniques (i.e. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), generate models to predict crop yield based on climatic and agricultural inputs.
3.	To offer actionable insights for policymakers and farmers through identifying regions resilient to climate change and recommending adapted practices.
